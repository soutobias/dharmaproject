        *According to Wikipedia, "There is no single word translation for "dharma" in Western languages. The meaning of the word "dharma" depends on context, and its meaning has evolved as the ideas of Hinduism have developed over its long history, in older texts, dharma meant cosmic law. In later Vedas, the meaning became refined, richer, complex, and the word "dharma" was applied in different contexts."
        We like the interpretation of the word that "dharma designates human behaviors considered necessary in the universe, principles that prevent chaos" and our search is through the chaotic relations between agents and narratives that move the world. Also, this other passage "with respect to its spiritual meaning, it can be considered as the "Way to Higher Truth". In a way, excusing the mixing of different meanings and with all due respect to its sacred meaning, we are somehow also searching for some truth, even though we don't, by all means, have the pretension to call it higher truth.
